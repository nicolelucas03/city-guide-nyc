* Develop layout skills using CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
* Learn about web typography and spacing
* Build confidence working without templates or libraries

### Features 
- Landing Page with hero image and welcome image

### Future Improvements
- Add interactice features using JavaScript (e.g. filtering neighborhoods, lightbox for images)
* Include a Google Maps embed or interactive map section
* Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, tab navigation)
* Explore adding SASS or CSS variables for better maintainability

### Reflections 
This project helped me get comfortable writing code from scratch and thinking through visual structure. It also sparked my interest in how design and development intersect on the web.
